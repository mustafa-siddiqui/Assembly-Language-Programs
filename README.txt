Participating in Extra Credit Challenge: YES

Group Dynamics:

Part 1:	Binary Search
	The code for this was implemented by Carter.
Part 2:	Matrix Multiplication
	The code for this was implemented by Mustafa.
Part 3:	Find min, max, median
	We used the Merge Sort algorithm to sort this first. Code for this was implemented by Carter.
Part 4:	Merge Sort
	Both of us worked on this code. Carter did more code writing the first time and Mustafa took part in finalizing the 	    code. Both of us worked together and went over the code to optimize it.

-----------------------------------

Important Things about Code:
	- For part 1, our code just prints out the index at which the number is found or a string if not found.
	- For part 2, our code prints out the final matrix result.
	- For part 3, we print out our values with strings indicating what the value is.
	- For part 4, our code prints out the sorted array.
	Fun fact: our code for part 4 has zero no-ops in it.
